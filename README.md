# opengl-sphere-animation
Hi! this is a project from my computer graphics course, It's a very simple game engine with some physics support.
Made in C++ using OpenGL
To see this engine in it's full glory, just clone the repository or download the project.exe file and run it!
It's an animation of a sphere moving in a 3d space, including rendering, lighting and simple physics applied on the sphere.
Also included particle effects for confetti
Updates in the future:
will record the animation and upload video so people don't have to clone the repository to see the effects
use Adobe flash to host this on the internet so you can see it in real time
start creating more models such as blocks, houses, and make the scene more "wow" for effect
